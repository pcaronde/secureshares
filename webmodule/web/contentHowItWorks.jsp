<h4>Four easy steps to secure file sharing</h4>
<ol>
<li>An authorized and authenticated user uploads a file via a secure connection using https.</li>
<li>The file is stored securely on the server for a defined period (e.g. one download, one day, one week)</li>
<li>An email is sent to the intended recipient(s) which includes a secure link (again using https) to the file</li>
<li>The recipient then downloads the file safely to her computer</li>
</ol> 
<br />
<p>With <b>SecureShares</b> you are assured of secure storage and transmission of your files and once downloaded in the case you choose the single download option or after the time you allot to keep it available. 
After that, it is removed from the server forever.
